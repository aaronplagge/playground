### PLAYGROUND

This is just a simple place for me to test things out.  I have become familiar with python just by researching and doing.  
In high school (Long long time ago) I had classes on C++ and pascal.  While I remember nothing of pascal I have gone
back and revisited C++ on various ocations.  I however am still not any good at it.  I have recently looked at more
modern languages such as Go and Rust.  Part of me would like to persue rust but due to the drama and there being fewer
jobs I have not been convinced to continue with it.  Go on the other hand has more job prospects but hasn't really
been able to convince me either.  

I know I should pick one to work on.  Who knows.  Python is probably the best option as I am already familiar with and
using it.
