# convtemp
Figured I would do this in python as well.  I have just completed a ["rust version"](https://github.com/aaronplagge/playground/blob/master/rust/convtemp/src/main.rs). 
I know here I will have access to `argparse`.  Also while this should be simple
I will still setup a class just because.  I am working on learning rust for my
own enlightenment and have been using python on some level for years now.
